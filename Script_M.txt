kabir: We’re going to have the time of our lives.  
imraan: Provided Mr. Workaholic here doesn’t run back to his laptop.  
arjun: I’m here, aren’t I?  
imraan: Yeah, but your soul is still in the stock market.  
imraan: This is insane! Tomatoes everywhere!  
kabir: Don’t just stand there, throw!  
arjun: I’m not wasting food.  
imraan: Food? This is Spain, my friend. This is tradition.  
kabir: Arjun, loosen up!  
arjun: Fine… take this!  
imraan: That’s the spirit!  
arjun: I can’t do this.  
kabir: You can. Trust me.  
imraan: If you die, I’ll write a poem for you.  
arjun: Not funny.   
arjun: No.  
kabir: Yes.  
imraan: Jump!  
arjun: AAAAAAAHHHHHH!  
imraan: Look at him! He’s flying!  
arjun: I’m alive… I’m actually alive!  
arjun: This is beautiful.  
kabir: Feels like another world.  
imraan: I can’t talk underwater, but I’m smiling.  
arjun: I don’t want this to end.  
imraan: Seize the day, my friends. Because tomorrow may never come.  
imraan: We live once, we die once. But if we live right, once is enough.  
imraan: The heart beats only so many times. Make each beat count.  
kabir: I don’t want to marry Natasha.  
arjun: Then why did you propose?  
imraan: Because he panicked.  
kabir: Because I thought it was right. But it’s not.  
arjun: Then tell her the truth.  
imraan: Better now than later.  
imraan: This trip changed everything.  
kabir: We’re not the same people anymore.  
arjun: And that’s a good thing.  
imraan: Zindagi na milegi dobara.  
kabir: We’re fine, thanks.  
imraan: Lost? We’re explorers.  
arjun: He means we’re tourists.    
arjun: Diving? I don’t think so.  
imraan: Kabir, admit it. You’re scared of marriage.  
kabir: I’m not scared. I’m just… cautious.  
arjun: Cautious? You proposed in a panic.  
imraan: Panic proposal. Classic Kabir.  
kabir: Shut up, both of you.  
imraan: This is war!  
kabir: Take cover!  
arjun: You’re insane.  
imraan: Insanity is underrated.  
kabir: Arjun, throw!  
arjun: Fine… take this!  
imraan: Bullseye!  
arjun: I can’t breathe.  
kabir: You’re fine.  
imraan: If you faint, I’ll write a poem.  
arjun: Stop joking.  
instructor: Three… two… one… jump!  
arjun: AAAAAAAHHHHHH!  
imraan: Look at him! He’s flying!  
arjun: I’m alive… I’m actually alive!  
arjun: It’s so peaceful.  
kabir: Feels like silence has a sound.  
imraan: I wish we could stay here forever.  
arjun: I don’t want this to end.  
imraan: Seize the day, my friends. Because tomorrow may never come.  
imraan: We live once, we die once. But if we live right, once is enough.  
imraan: The heart beats only so many times. Make each beat count.  
kabir: This is madness.  
arjun: People actually do this?  
imraan: And we’re about to join them.  
kabir: I’m not ready.  
arjun: None of us are.  
imraan: That’s the point.  
kabir: Run!  
arjun: Faster!  
imraan: This is life!  
kabir: Cheers, boys! To friendship.  
imraan: To bad decisions and worse hangovers.  
arjun: I don’t drink on weekdays.  
imraan: Spain doesn’t have weekdays, only fiestas.  
kabir: Come on, Arjun. One drink won’t kill you.  
arjun: It might kill my schedule.  
imraan: Your schedule needs a funeral anyway.  
kabir: He’s right. You work too much.  
arjun: I work because I have to.  
imraan: And we party because we want to. Balance, my friend.  
kabir: Exactly. Tonight, no worries. Just us.  
arjun: Fine. One drink.  
imraan: Make it three. One for each of your personalities.  
kabir: Ha! He’s loosening up.  
arjun: Don’t push it.  
imraan: Push it? I’ll shove it. Bartender, another round!  
kabir: This is going to be a long night.  
imraan: Look at this place… every corner feels alive.  
kabir: Spain doesn’t sleep, man.  
arjun: And we’re supposed to be up early tomorrow.  
imraan: Tomorrow is a myth. Tonight is real.  
kabir: He’s right. Just enjoy it.  
arjun: I’m trying.  
imraan: Trying? You don’t try to live, you just live.  
kabir: Come on, Arjun. Smile for once.  
arjun: Fine… there. Happy?  
imraan: That’s not a smile, that’s constipation.  
kabir: Ha! He got you.  
arjun: You two are impossible.  
imraan: And you’re impossible to resist. Bartender! Another round!  
kabir: We’re not even in a bar.  
imraan: Then let’s make the street our bar.  
arjun: You’re insane.  
kabir: Insanity looks good on us.  
kabir: Seatbelts on, gentlemen. Spain awaits!  
imraan: Spain awaits my poetry, not your driving.  
arjun: Just keep your eyes on the road.  
imraan: He drives like he’s auditioning for Formula One.  
kabir: Better than you, who thinks the horn is a musical instrument.  
arjun: Can we not fight before breakfast?  
imraan: Breakfast is overrated. Sarcasm is the most important meal of the day.  
kabir: Finally! My two best friends in one place.  
imraan: Correction — your two worst influences.  
arjun: And your two biggest critics.  
kabir: I missed this.  
imraan: You missed me more. Admit it.  
arjun: He missed the chaos.  
kabir: I missed both.  
imraan: Spain won’t know what hit it.  
arjun: Spain won’t survive you two.  
kabir: Come on, Arjun. Loosen up.  
imraan: Yeah, Mr. Spreadsheet. This is a holiday, not a quarterly review.  
arjun: I’m here, aren’t I?  
kabir: And that’s enough for now.  
imraan: For now. But by the end of this trip, you’ll thank us.  
imraan: Gentlemen, may I present… Bagwati.  
kabir: Stop it, Imraan. It’s just a handbag.  
imraan: Just a handbag? This is no ordinary handbag. This is Bagwati.  
arjun: You’re insane.  
imraan: Bagwati is not just a bag, she’s a personality. She deserves respect.  
kabir: You’re going to get us killed. Natasha will murder you if she hears this.  
imraan: Bagwati is a free spirit. She doesn’t belong to Natasha. She belongs to the world.  
arjun: You’ve officially lost it.  
imraan: Lost it? I’ve found it. Bagwati is love. Bagwati is life.  
kabir: I can’t believe I’m listening to this.  
imraan: Bow down, my friends. Bow down to Bagwati.  
arjun: I’m not bowing to a handbag.  
kabir: Neither am I.  
imraan: Then you don’t deserve her.  
kabir: Guys, meet Bagwati.  
imraan: Bagwati?  
kabir: Natasha’s new handbag. She’s obsessed with it.  
arjun: You’re introducing a handbag?  
imraan: Not just a handbag… this is Bagwati.  
kabir: Don’t start, Imraan.  
imraan: She’s got presence. She deserves respect.  
arjun: You two have lost it.  
kabir: I’m serious. Natasha treats it like family.  
imraan: Then we must bow down. Bagwati has entered our lives.  
arjun: I’m not bowing to a handbag.  
kabir: Neither am I.  
imraan: Then you don’t deserve her.
