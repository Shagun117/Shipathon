17/01/26, 9:05 pm - Raghav: Who’s up for a late-night game?
17/01/26, 9:06 pm - Shagun: I’m in. Victory shall be mine.
17/01/26, 9:07 pm - Neil: You always say that and then rage-quit.
17/01/26, 9:08 pm - Shagun: Rage is passion. Passion is fuel. Fuel is victory.
17/01/26, 9:09 pm - Raghav: That made zero sense.
17/01/26, 9:10 pm - Neil: He’s just trying to sound wise.
17/01/26, 9:11 pm - Shagun: Trying? I *am* wise.
17/01/26, 9:12 pm - Raghav: Wise people don’t lose every round.
17/01/26, 9:13 pm - Shagun: I let you win. It builds character.
17/01/26, 9:14 pm - Neil: My character is fine. Yours needs therapy.
17/01/26, 9:30 pm - Raghav: Bro, why are you carrying that giant backpack? We’re just going for coffee.
17/01/26, 9:30 pm - Shagun: It's not a backpack, it's a lifestyle:)
17/01/26, 9:30 pm - Neil: Lifestyle? It looks like you’re moving houses.
17/01/26, 9:30 pm - Raghav: He probably packed his entire wardrobe.
17/01/26, 9:30 pm - Shagun: You mock now, but when you need a charger, a book, or an umbrella, you’ll thank me.
17/01/26, 9:31 pm - Neil: Or we’ll just buy coffee and not survive a monsoon in the café.
17/01/26, 9:31 pm - Raghav: Exactly. Minimalism, my friend.
17/01/26, 9:31 pm - Shagun: Minimalism is boring. I’m prepared for adventure.
17/01/26, 9:31 pm - Neil: Adventure? We’re going to the corner café.
17/01/26, 9:31 pm - Raghav: With him, even the corner café turns into a road trip.
17/01/26, 9:31 pm - Shagun: And you two are the worst travel companions. Always serious, always cautious.
17/01/26, 9:32 pm - Neil: Someone has to keep you alive.
17/01/26, 9:32 pm - Raghav: And someone has to keep you laughing.
17/01/26, 9:32 pm - Shagun: Which is why you need me.
17/01/26, 9:32 pm - Neil: You’re basically a stand‑up comedian with bad timing.
17/01/26, 9:32 pm - Shagun: Bad timing? I’m the king of timing.
17/01/26, 9:33 pm - Raghav: He’s the king of exaggeration.
17/01/26, 9:33 pm - Shagun: Exaggeration is an art.
17/01/26, 9:33 pm - Neil: And you’re Picasso of nonsense.
17/01/26, 9:33 pm - Raghav: Don’t fight, boys. Let’s just get coffee.
17/01/26, 9:33 pm - Shagun: Coffee? No, no. Today feels like a smoothie day.
17/01/26, 9:34 pm - Neil: Smoothie? That’s twice the price.
17/01/26, 9:34 pm - Shagun: Twice the fun.
17/01/26, 9:34 pm - Raghav: He’s going to bankrupt us one café at a time.
17/01/26, 9:34 pm - Neil: At least he’ll keep us entertained while we go broke.
17/01/26, 9:34 pm - Shagun: Exactly. I’m the investment that pays in laughter.
17/01/26, 9:35 pm - Raghav: Eternal pizza… sounds like a religion.
17/01/26, 9:35 pm - Neil: My character is fine. Yours needs therapy.
17/01/26, 9:35 pm - Shagun: Therapy? Nah. I’m the cure for boredom.
17/01/26, 9:36 pm - Raghav: You’re also the cause of chaos.
17/01/26, 9:36 pm - Neil: And somehow both at the same time.
17/01/26, 9:46 pm - Shagun: Pizza night?
17/01/26, 9:46 pm - Raghav: Always. Extra cheese.
17/01/26, 9:47 pm - Neil: No, no. Salad for me.
17/01/26, 9:48 pm - Shagun: Salad? That’s not food, that’s decoration.
17/01/26, 9:49 pm - Raghav: He’s right. Salad is what food eats.
17/01/26, 9:50 pm - Neil: Laugh all you want. I’m not spending tomorrow regretting cheese overload.
17/01/26, 9:51 pm - Shagun: Regret is temporary. Pizza is eternal.
17/01/26, 9:52 pm - Raghav: Eternal pizza… sounds like a religion.
17/01/26, 9:53 pm - Shagun: I’d join.
17/01/26, 10:25 pm - Raghav: I need new shoes.
17/01/26, 10:25 pm - Shagun: Shoes don’t matter. Confidence does.
17/01/26, 10:26 pm - Neil: Confidence doesn’t protect your feet.
17/01/26, 10:26 pm - Shagun: True, but style does.
17/01/26, 10:26 pm - Raghav: I’ll just buy something simple.
17/01/26, 10:26 pm - Shagun: Simple is boring. Go bold. Neon green.
17/01/26, 10:26 pm - Neil: Please don’t.
17/01/26, 10:27 pm - Raghav: Yeah, I’m not walking around like a traffic light.
17/01/26, 10:27 pm - Shagun: You’d be unforgettable.
17/01/26, 10:27 pm - Neil: You’d be unbearable.
